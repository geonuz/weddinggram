## üõ† Getting Started
This application is implemented using **Firebase**. Before running the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure Firebase
- Obtain a **JSON key file** via the **Firebase Admin SDK**.
- Set the correct path for `FIREBASE_KEY_PATH` in `config.toml`.

### 2. Set Up Firestore Collections
The **Cloud Firestore** database must include the following three collections:
- `wedding_guestbook`
- `wedding_post`
- `wedding_story`

### 3. Firestore Document Structures
#### üìù 'Post' Document Example
To upload a **Post**, a document must be created in the **`wedding_post`** collection with the following structure:
```json
{
  "order": 9,
  "name": "john",
  "profile_image": "john.png",
  "post_image": ["sample1.jpg", "sample2.jpg", "sample3.mp4"],
  "text": "This is a sample message.",
  "like": 5,
  "explore": true,  // (Optional) Set true to post in 'Explore' instead of 'Home'
  "is_large": false, // (Optional) Set true to make the post appear larger (1x2 size in 'Explore')
  "thumbnail": "sample1.jpg" // (Optional) Thumbnail for 'Explore' posts
}
```

#### üåç 'Story' Document Example
To upload **Story media**, create a document in the **`wedding_story`** collection with this structure:
```json
{
  "name": "john",
  "profile_image": "john.png",
  "story_media": ["sample1.jpg", "sample2.jpg", "sample3.mp4"]
}
```

After creating the document, you must insert static files into the following directories:
- `static/media/post/` (for post images and videos)
- `static/media/story/` (for story images and videos)
- `static/media/profile_image/` (for profile pictures)
